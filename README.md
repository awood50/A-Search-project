Instructions

Write a program that implements the A* algorithm to find a path from any two given nodes.  You may use any of the following languages: C++, C#, Java, ActionScript.

Problem Overview & Algorithm Description

In a fully-observable environment where there are both pathable and blocked nodes, an agent must find a good path from their starting node to the goal node.  The agent must use the A* algorithm to determine its path.  For this program, you must use the Manhattan method for calculating the heuristic.
